1. Check with your course manager for any important announcements.

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Lesson 10 Topics That Require Careful Attention

1. Remind the students what ASP.NET Core MVC is.
1. Just like lesson 8, lesson 10 includes short videos that provide guided, live-coding practice. Remind the students that the text included before and after the clips is NOT intended as a replacement for the videos.
1. Razor templates inject C# code directly into otherwise typical HTML. This may feel strange to students and require a review of the notion.
1. Mention the role of ``ViewBag`` and how to add properties.
1. Touch upon ``Shared/_Layout.cshtml`` and Bootstrap basics.
1. Show some examples of how to add route links with ``asp-controller`` and ``asp-action``.

## Small Group Time: Lesson 10 Studio (TA Notes)

1. Do your best to help students who may be stuck with any Visual Studio build issues, errors, or warnings.
1. Walk around and make sure no one is struggling with forking, cloning, and opening the starter code.
1. This studio is designed to be solved sequentially as the students move down the page. Trying to solve later sections before the earlier ones is an option, but this will make the overall task more difficult.
1. Encourage the students to explore altering the css to improve page styling.
