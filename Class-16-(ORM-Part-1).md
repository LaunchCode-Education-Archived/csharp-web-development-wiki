## Small Group Time: Class 16 Studio (TA Notes)

1. If students didn't finish the exercises, they need to start with the exercises first. If they did not finish following along with the videos, they need to check out the appropriate branch in their ``CodingEventsDemo`` repository to see what they have left. If they do not have this branch, they need to fetch it from the upstream.
   1. To do so, they need to make sure the upstream is set up with ``git remote -v`` and double check that they are on ``master``.
   1. With the upstream present, run ``git fetch upstream``
   1. Then merge the upstream into the forked repo with ``git merge upstream/master``.
1. Check in with your students!
