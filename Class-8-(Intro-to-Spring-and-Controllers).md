### Class 8 Topics That Require Careful Attention

1. The C#/ASP.NET development environment can be tricky. We've included required configuration checks
in the book. Be sure to check that these are met. Some students may encounter issues that we were not able to anticipate in the text. Some minor versions of the software may be different than what is listed in the text. If a student has an environment or build issue, do your best to reassure them that these types of configuration hurdles can be common.

1. Lesson 8 content includes a number of short videos meant to be coding walkthroughs. Remind the students that it is critical to code along with these. We introduce some Visual Studio tips they may find useful, as well as provide visual aids for the controller tasks we give them.

1. You may find it useful to review some relevant HTTP topics since a foundational understanding of the protocol is expected.

1. ``[Route()]`` is the first C# annotation students have seen that can take a parameter.

## Small Group Time: Class 8 Studio (TA Notes)

1. This studio will be the students' first foray into creating their own MVC project. Remind them that they will only need to pay close attention to the ``Controllers`` directory for now.
1. Some students may also benefit from a reminder of how to create a ``select`` tag.
